      Hello there,<br>
      hello there.<br>
      It is idealist cat right here.<br>
      I am doing voice to text.<br>
      This is going to be annoying to edit it later. (wasn't)<br>
      I'm sure, but yes, this is a cool log site.<br>
      Hopefully, I will try and do it every day.<br>
      I don't know, we'll see.<br>
      I did like some sort of github template for this 
      and then I had to use that template for this.<br>
      I'm proud of that OK?<br>
      They're a basic site I know it looks boring<br>
      but it's not supposed to be anything special if you get it.<br> 
      I don't know where this idea came from.<br>
      But originally I wanna like a super detailed site,<br>
      but I decided against it cause with the new thing.<br>
      I'm doing called drawpro with the site for that.<br>
      It looks cool so yeah, I liked how I made that site.<br>
      And I wanted to do something like that, but honestly no,<br>
      I'm good, anyway bye bye.<br>
