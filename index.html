      Hello there,
      hello there.
      It is idealist cat right here.
      I am doing voice to text.
      This is going to be annoying to edit it later.
      I'm sure, but yes, this is a cool log site.
      Hopefully, I will try and do it every day.
      I don't know, we'll see.
      I did like some sort of github template for this
      and then I had to use that template for this.
      I'm proud of that OK?
      They're a basic site I know it looks boring
      but it's not supposed to be nothing special if you get it. 
      I don't know where this idea came from.
      But originally I wanna like a super detailed site,
      but I decided against it cause with the new thing.
      I'm doing calle drawpro with the site for that.
      It looks cool so yeah, I liked how I made that site.
      And I wanted to do something like that, but honestly no,
      I'm good, anyway bye bye.
